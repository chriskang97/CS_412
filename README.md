# CS_412: Introduction to Data Mining 

Python scripts that implements several Data Mining concepts learned during class. Though most of the algorithms are already implemented online, these assignments helped us learn the concepts and algorithms more in-depth. 

## HW 3: Apriori Pruning 


## HW 4: Decision Trees, Naive Bayes 

## HW 5: K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model
